# TicTacToe-Player
This program uses the min-max algorithm to play its self in tic tac toe. The min max algorithm works by iterating through a tree with thhe possible plays within the game. As the algorithm recessively goes down the tree, each generation will change between the min player and max player. The max player chooses the highest static value (most optimal move) and the min chooses the lowest static value(most optimal move for min) . For efficiency the tree will only be two levels deep. When the optimal move is chosen off of these two levels, two more levels of the tree will be produced.
